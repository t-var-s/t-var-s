### Hello there ğŸ‘‹

I ğŸ’™ the web and the relative immediacy of it. Anyone can make a website and everyone can open it, or at least that's the underlying promise of it. 
Professionally ğŸ”¨ I've been developing hybrid mobile apps, back-end services and content management systems. 
So far ğŸ“¢ these have been mainly for events and education, domains where rich content is king and assumptions are validated quickly.
