### Hello there 👋

I really love the web and the relative immediacy of it. Anyone can make a website and everyone can open it, or at least that's the underlying promise of it. Professionally, I usually develop hybrid mobile apps, back-end services and content management systems. So far, these have been mainly for events and education, domains where rich content is king and assumptions are validated quickly.

I enjoy writing in my 🌍 https://viewfromtheweb.com/ blog to help me learn and think.
